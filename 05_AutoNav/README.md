## Tuning Parameters — `config.py`

**All parameters live in the root `config.py`.** Change a value there and restart `autonav_bridge.py` — no need to edit any other file.

### Path / Waypoint

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `AUTONAV_LOOKAHEAD_M` | `1.0` | Pure Pursuit lookahead distance (m). Larger = smoother path, cuts corners more. Smaller = tighter waypoint tracking. |
| `AUTONAV_REACH_TOL_M` | `0.5` | Arrival radius (m). Robot advances to next waypoint when raw GPS is within this distance. RTK cm accuracy supports values as low as 0.3 m. |
| `AUTONAV_ARRIVE_FRAMES` | `1` | Consecutive frames inside `REACH_TOL_M` required to confirm arrival. 1 = immediate (reliable with RTK). Raise to 2–3 if false arrivals occur from GPS jumps. |
| `AUTONAV_DECEL_RADIUS_M` | `1.5` | Distance from the **final** waypoint where the robot begins decelerating. Increase for heavier/faster robots that need more braking distance. |

### Speed

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `AUTONAV_MAX_LINEAR_VEL` | `1.0` | Maximum forward speed (m/s). Hard ceiling applied before `speed_ratio` slider. |
| `AUTONAV_MIN_LINEAR_VEL` | `0.1` | Minimum speed during end-of-path deceleration (m/s). Prevents the robot from stopping mid-approach. |
| `AUTONAV_MAX_ANGULAR_VEL` | `1.0` | Maximum angular velocity (rad/s). Clamps PID output. |
| `AUTONAV_MANUAL_SPEED` | `0.4` | Speed used by the W/S manual drive buttons (m/s). |

### Steering Behaviour

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `AUTONAV_TURN_IN_PLACE_DEG` | `10.0` | If heading error exceeds this threshold (°), the robot stops forward motion and rotates in place before driving. Set `0` to disable (always move forward). Larger values = more aggressive cornering. |
| `AUTONAV_TURN_SLOWDOWN` | `True` | Scale linear speed down proportionally with heading error (full speed at 0°, `MIN_LINEAR` at 60°+). Reduces overshoot on corrections. |
| `AUTONAV_DEAD_ZONE_DEG` | `3.0` | Heading errors smaller than this are treated as zero — no correction issued. Prevents continuous micro-corrections and motor chatter. Raise to 5–8° if the robot oscillates slightly while driving straight. |

### PID Gains

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `AUTONAV_PID_KP` | `0.15` | Proportional gain. Saturation point = `MAX_ANGULAR / KP` (at 0.15: saturates at 6.7° error). Raise for faster response; lower if oscillation appears. |
| `AUTONAV_PID_KI` | `0.005` | Integral gain. Corrects persistent steady-state heading offset. Keep small — large values cause slow wind-up oscillation. |
| `AUTONAV_PID_KD` | `0.15` | Derivative gain. Damps overshoot. Raise (→ 0.3) if the robot overshoots after turns; lower if commands become jittery. |

### Filters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `AUTONAV_MA_WINDOW` | `5` | GPS sliding-average window (frames). At 5 Hz: 5 frames = 1 s of smoothing. Reduces bearing jumps from RTK multipath. Decrease if path response feels sluggish. |
| `AUTONAV_HEADING_ALPHA` | `0.3` | Heading exponential low-pass coefficient (0 < α ≤ 1). α = 1.0: raw IMU (no filter). α = 0.3: ~0.6 s time constant. α = 0.1: ~2 s (very slow). Lower if physical robot swing causes oscillation; raise if heading display lags. |

### Field Tuning Quick Reference

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Robot snakes / oscillates | Lower `KP`, raise `DEAD_ZONE_DEG`, lower `HEADING_ALPHA` |
| Heading display lags behind actual | Raise `HEADING_ALPHA` |
| Robot doesn't reach waypoint, loops back | Raise `REACH_TOL_M`, lower `ARRIVE_FRAMES` |
| Robot cuts corners / skips waypoints | Lower `LOOKAHEAD_M`, lower `REACH_TOL_M` |
| Robot overshoots and spins | Raise `KD`, enable `TURN_IN_PLACE_DEG` |
| Robot turns wrong way | Set `ANGULAR_SIGN = -1` in `autonav_algo.py` |

## Waypoint File (`path.csv`)

Tab or comma separated (auto-detected). `lat`/`lon` are required; `type` and `lift` are optional.

```
lat,lon,type,lift
38.94130,-92.31896,,
38.94140,-92.31880,pause,up
```
- `type`: free-text label; `pause` forces a stop at that waypoint.
- `lift`: `up` / `down` triggers the lift actuator; anything else is ignored.

**Runtime upload**: click **LOAD CSV** in the dashboard to load any CSV without restarting. Navigation resets to idle and the waypoint table updates immediately.

### Generating `path.csv` from a manual run

There's no separate GPS survey step to get precise field coordinates ahead of time — instead,
drive the planned route once and convert the recording into waypoints:

1. Drive the route via the `04_Robot` web UI, pressing **REC** before starting and stopping it
   at the end. This writes `04_Robot/data_log/run_<timestamp>.jsonl`.
2. Run `python 05_AutoNav/build_waypoints_from_run.py`. It picks the newest `run_*.jsonl` by
   default, downsamples the recorded RTK track so consecutive waypoints are at least
   `WAYPOINT_MIN_DISTANCE_M` apart (`config.py`), and writes
   `05_AutoNav/data_log/path_<run_ts>_<density>m.csv`.
3. Adjust `WAYPOINT_MIN_DISTANCE_M` to change waypoint density and re-run step 2 — no need to
   re-drive, since it re-processes the same recording.
4. Load the result via **LOAD CSV**, or copy/rename it to `path.csv` and restart `autonav_bridge.py`.

## Heading Calibration

IMU `heading.deg` depends on `north_offset_deg`. To calibrate in the field:

1. Park robot at origin. Click **MARK POS** to record current GPS position.
2. Drive robot straight forward several metres (use W button or joystick).
3. Return robot to origin.
4. Click **CALIBRATE** — the bridge computes `bearing(origin → mark)`, subtracts `heading.raw`, and sends `set_north_offset` to `01_IMU` bridge via WebSocket. `heading.deg` is updated live.

The calibration panel shows:
- **MARKED** — recorded forward GPS point
- **CURRENT** — live GPS position
- **BEARING** — current→mark bearing (the expected heading at origin)
- **OFFSET** — last applied `north_offset_deg` (green = applied)

## Debugging

Enable verbose terminal output — set in `autonav_algo.py`:

```python
ALGO_DEBUG = True
```

Offline testing without hardware:

```bash
# Terminal 1: replay recorded IMU + RTK data
python replay_imu_rtk.py

# Terminal 2: start navigation
python autonav_bridge.py
```

Monitor output stream:

```bash
python listen_autonav.py
```

## Ports

| Purpose | Port |
|---------|------|
| HTTP Dashboard | 8805 |
| AutoNav WebSocket (status + control) | 8806 |
| Reads IMU WS | 8766 |
| Reads RTK WS | 8776 |
| Writes Robot WS | 8889 |

## Safety

- **Sensor timeout**: navigation auto-pauses if GPS or IMU data age exceeds `AUTONAV_GPS_TIMEOUT_S` (default 5 s); auto-resumes when sensors recover.
- **GPS fix filter**: frames with `fix_quality == 0` now pause navigation immediately instead of continuing to consume stale RTK coordinates.
- **Robot send watchdog**: each velocity command send is bounded by `AUTONAV_ROBOT_SEND_TIMEOUT_S`; if the WebSocket stalls, the control loop drops the command and reconnects instead of hanging.
- **Watchdog heartbeat**: zero-velocity command sent to `robot_bridge` every second to prevent runaway on connection loss.
- **Manual drive interlock**: W/S buttons only work in `idle` state — cannot override an active navigation session.
- **M4 command watchdog**: `CIRCUITPY/code.py` zeroes motor speed if no `V` command is received within 500 ms. This ensures the robot stops even if the Pi–M4 serial link or the robot_bridge WS connection drops mid-navigation.

## WS Client Design Note — Always Drain Incoming Messages

`RobotWsClient` connects to `robot_bridge` to **send** joystick commands. However, `robot_bridge` also **broadcasts** odom data (20 Hz) back to every connected WS client.

If the client never reads these incoming messages, the following chain causes periodic disconnection (~43 s):

```
robot_bridge sends odom 20 Hz
  → autonav never reads it
  → websockets internal queue fills
  → OS TCP receive buffer fills (~87 KB / 2 KB·s⁻¹ ≈ 43 s)
  → TCP Window = 0  (receiver tells sender "stop")
  → robot_bridge's await ws.send(odom) blocks
  → robot_bridge event loop stalls
  → autonav's await ws.send(joystick) waits for ACK > timeout
  → connection dropped
```

**Rule**: any WS client that does not need incoming data must still drain the socket:

```python
# correct — drains and discards
async for _ in ws:
    pass

# wrong — never reads; buffer fills and causes TCP backpressure
await ws.wait_closed()
```

This applies to all "write-only" WS clients in this codebase (`ImuWsClient`, `RtkWsClient`, `RobotWsClient`). TCP backpressure on a bidirectional connection propagates stalls from the receive direction into the send direction.
